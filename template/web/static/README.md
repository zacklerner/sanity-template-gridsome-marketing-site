Add static files here. Files in this directory will be copied directly to `dist` folder during build. For example, /static/robots.txt will be located at https://yoursite.com/robots.txt.

By default this folder will also contain a json file with the site's search index. This index is generated by `gridsome.server.js` on `build` to allow searching within portable text fields by FlexsearchJS. 

This file should be deleted.
